# Garbi
Today, huge amounts of waste/garbage are generated every
day, which has further increased pressure on landfills and caused eco- logical
concerns worldwide. Recycling seems to be the best long-term a solution
to this problem and waste segregation is most important prerequisite for recycling.
In this project, we have implemented a ”Smart
Garbage In-house Segregation Plant - GARB-I” which gives impetus
to garbage recycling in hotels and helps them in fulfilling the mandatory
recycling requirements. This project executes garbage segregation
into Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable waste and also provide
a comfortable, energy-efficient, and safe working environment for the hotel
staff. This project has been implemented with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and sensors like humidity, temperature, air quality, 
ultrasonic sensor, motion sensor, as well as simulated sensors
and actuators like motors and relays. The data from these sensors
is processed by the Raspberry Pi and AI planner. The data published
via Sensor and Actuator topics is published via indirect communication
through MQTT and subscribed for visualization by a dashboard on client end.
